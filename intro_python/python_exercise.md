# TRICK OR TREAT PYTHON
Work in small groups, and work as group to figure how to use the data types, structures, and methods we discussed to solve these prompts:
1. Get everyone's first names. Add each person's name to the data structure. Whose name comes first?
2. Get everyone's favorite number (or age). Calculate the average number for the group (hint: average is sum of all numbers divided by number of people in the group)
3. Create a data structure to store each a set of movies (maybe your favorite halloween themed one?). Update the structure to keep a count for each movie depending on how many people in the group have seen the movie. Make sure that you don't keep any movie that only has a count of one.

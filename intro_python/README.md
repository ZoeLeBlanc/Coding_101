### What is Python?
- Programming language, created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum
- Named after Monty Python
- Used for a wide range of programming, from making web apps to data analysis

**Why Python?**
'Python is almost always the second best language for any prblem'

### Open your terminal and check your python version
Type:
```sh
python --version
python3 --version
```

### Let's start coding
In your terminal, type `python3`. This will open the interactive python interpreter where you can write your python code and have the computer execute it. 

1. Type `'Hello world'`
Congrats you've just typed your first bit of python and had the computer execute it ðŸŽ‰!

Let's breakdown what just happened.
1. You entered data into the interpreter
2. That data had a certain format, in this case variable, and the interpreter automatically showed that data again.

What if we wanted to save our data?

### Variables
We can save our hello world data into a *variable* and keep using it again and again. 

```python
var = 'Hello world'
```
Now try typing `var` again. What happens?

The `var` variable now has 'Hello world' stored inside. Python understands that our variable contains a *string*. You can type any string and store it into a variable.
```python
one = 'one'
two = 'two'
three = 'three'
```

### Data Types
Strings are just one type of data type accepted in Python. 

There's also numbers, called *integers*. We can take our variables that we assigned before and assign them their actual numbers.
```python
one = 1
two = 2
```
Once we do this though, our strings that were stored in these variables will be erased!

What happens if you try and use a number for your variable?
```python
1 = 1
```
You'll get a syntax error ðŸ˜…! That's because Python has rules for how to name variables.

- A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume) | 
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character |
- A variable name cannot start with a number |
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) |
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)| 


So our previous example could work if we changed the variable name to:
```python
one_1 = 1
```

Python also has a special name for decimal numbers, called *floats*.
```python
one = 1.0
```

What if we decided that we wanted to combine variable one and two? We could use a Python *method* for manipulating variables and data.

1. To join variables together use the `+` symbol, this is called concatenation.
```python
one + two
```
You should see `3.0` as your answer. We just added the data in variable one and two together. 
What would happend if we added variables `var` and `three` togther?
```python
var + three
```

2. Other methods that you can use on integers and floats:
division:
```python
one / two
```

multiplication:
```python
one * two
```

We can also assign a truth value to a variable, called a *boolean*.
```python
var_true = True
var_false = False
```
We can then check if these two variables contain the same truth value.
```python
var_true == var_false
```

In Python `=` is used to assign values to a variable, and `==` is used to check if two variables contain the same value.

### Quick Assignment
```
1. Turn to the people next to you and ask them their first name and age. 
2. Assign those values to variables and input your own first name and age in separate variables. 
3. Try testing if your names or ages are equal.
4. Try joining your names together.
5. Try adding/multiply/dividing your ages.
6. Try joining your ages and names together.
```

### Data Structures
Typing the information of two or three students is doable, but what if we wanted to do everyone in the workshop? Typing a new variable each time to assign their value is really tedious!

That's where data structures come in! In Python, we can store data types in various data structures that are optimized for different problems.

#### Lists
If we wanted to take the first names of everyone in the workshop, we could store them in a data structure called a *list*.
```python
names = ['Hermione', 'Harry', 'Ron']
```
A list is an unordered, comma-separated collection of any values. So we can store any combination of values in our list.
```python
names = ['Hermione', 'Harry', 'Ron', 42]
```
We can also store a list inside of another list.
```python
names = ['Hermione', 'Harry', 'Ron', 42, ['UVA', 'W&L']]
```
What if you want to just print out 'Hermione' from the list? We can do that by *indexing* the list. 
```python3
names[0]
```
Each list in Python is a sequence, and we can access the position of an item in that sequence through indexing. **In Python, indexes always start at zero!**

We can use indexing in all sorts of ways.
1. We can take the final item by using negative one, which tells python to get the last item from the list
```python3
names[-1]
```
1. We can take a range of items by using a colon to specify when we want to start and stop
```python3
names[1:3]
```
1. If we try to index longer than the list, we'll get an error that tells us we're out of range of the list
```python3
names[8]
```


What if we wanted to store information in a way that let us know what was a name or an age variable?

#### Dictionaries
We can use a *dictionary*, which is a collection of key/value pairs to store this information. Keys and values are always separated by a colon.

```python3
witch = { 'name': 'Hermione', 'age': 18}
```
To access our values in dictionaries, we don't use indexing. Instead, we use the keys of dictionary. Keys are always the values that come before the colon.
```python3
witch['name']
```
We write the key inside of brackets and quotations, called *bracket notation*. 

What happens if we add another name to the dictionary?
```python
witch = { 'name': 'Hermione', 'age': 18, 'name': 'Harry'}
```
Where's hermione??

Hermione was overwritten in our dictionary because our new value shared the same key. In a dictionary, keys must be unique!

Just like lists though we can store a dictionary inside of a dictionary
```python
hogwarts = {
    'student_1': {
        'name':'Hermione'
    },
    'student_2': {
        'name':'Harry'
    },
}
```
Now we can get Hermione's name if we type `hogwarts['student_1']['name']`. What's happening here is that we're using the keys to find our value that's nested inside a dictionary within a dictionary.

- First thing is the Command Line
sounds intimidating but it's not really
how do you find files in your computer?
Imagine you didn't have that way
That's where the command line comes in, the original way of using a computer

- Everyone open the cheatsheet
word on this first exercise together
go through creating, moving, 
some links to documentation

- Any questions

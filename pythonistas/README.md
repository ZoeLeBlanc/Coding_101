- Officially conquered the fundamentals of Python
- Officially written your own script
- Officially pros at using the terminal

### What could be left to learn???

What if we wanted to take our spooky script and have multiple people input answers before outputting?

- We could just keep copying and pasting our code. But our script would get long and difficult to read quickly.



#### For Loops
- For loops
re write madlibs


#### Conditionals
What if we wanted to have some order or not allow certain inputs?
- Conditionals


####Functions
Can we make this code cleaner
- Functions

DEBUG ASSIGNMENT

FINAL HALLOWEEN EPIC
- create a new directory
- create a file for each prompt
- write a script that takes an input and returns it backwards : the time traveler
- write a script that takes an input and counts how many words was entered : the zombie
- write a script that asks a question and tells them if they got it right or wrong: the sphinx
- combine all these scripts into one long script, turning each script into it's own function: the coven
### Zen of Python
Open up your terminal and enter the python interpreter, type:
```python
import this
```

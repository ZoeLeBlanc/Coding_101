# SPOOKY STORY SCRIPT

In a small group, divide up into pairs or three people. Together you'll be writing a spooky story.

Create a new script in your directory. In that script, start writing your spooky story.

In the script you need to have the following:
1. At least three prompts for inputs that are then assigned to be printed out as part of the story.
1. At least three built in string methods printed out as part of the story (Maybe you reverse someone's input, or print it out character by character)
1. A final print statement that prints out the length of the story

Once you've written your script, exchange with the other group in your group and see if your script runs correctly.

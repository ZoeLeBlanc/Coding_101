# Today's Agenda
- Start with an introduction to coding and computers |
- Then jump into writing some code with the command line |
- Then we'll do an introduction to Python |
- Followed by more complex ways of writing code |
- Finally you'll be writing your own scripts in Python |

---
# Code of Conduct
- No wrong questions |
- Ask for help using stickies |
- Be respectful |
- Be helpful |
- Try your best and keep an open mind |

### What is a computer even?

[Paul Ford **What is Code?**](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/#lets-begin)

Note: series of clocks/switches doing millions of computation. But how does it know what to do? We tell it with inputs! like a keyboard scroll down to keyboard visualization. But how does what we input turn into something the computer understands?

### Binary 
# 0 & 1
- Way of counting, just like our way of counting that uses the digits 0-9 |
- Turns our commands into machine readable language |

### Brief History of Computers

![assets/1.png](../intro_coding/assets/1.png)
brief history
computing didn't always look like your phone
abacus
WWII enigma machine
punch cards
a lot has changed but a lot hasn't
still fundamentally about 
### Women and Computers
- women have been doing computing for a long time
- Ada Lovelace
Grace Hopper
Bletchley Park

### So what is code?
tell the computer how to do what you want it do
can be anything from saving a file to 
can be done in multiple different ways
but needs to be executed -> transformed into a machine language -> becomes software
we do this with something called compilers
compilers translate what we've written back into binary and then the computer executes those commands
---
- Who can code?
YOU!
no literally you can code! and after today you'll officially be a coder
all of coding is creating logic and getting a computer to execute it -> sounds simple but feels magical
